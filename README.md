##Objectives
Management system for quarterly investment reports. Ideal product would read SEC txt files and show how a fund performed over four quarters. 

##Technologies  

    * Ruby 2.0.0
    * RSpec 3.0

##Still to do:

Project reads txt files but doesn't yet convert them to the Hash format required for analysis. With more time, I'd have loved to write a game-engine that made the project work in the command-line.

##How to run the tests

	* git clone https://github.com/tbeeley/Q-R-
	* cd Q-R-
	* rspec
